## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How long does concrete take to cure?**
A: Concrete reaches walking strength in 24-48 hours and driving strength in 7 days. Full strength is achieved in 28 days, though normal use can typically begin after one week.

### **Q: Can concrete be poured in any weather?**
A: We can work in most weather conditions with proper precautions. Extreme temperatures (below 35¬∞F or above 90¬∞F) require special procedures, and we avoid pouring during rain.

### **Q: How do you prevent cracking?**
A: We use proper reinforcement, control joints, appropriate concrete mixes, and proper curing techniques. Some minor cracking is normal, but structural cracking is prevented through good design and execution.

### **Q: Can you match existing concrete?**
A: We can often match color and texture of existing concrete, though exact matches can be challenging due to aging and weathering of the original surface.

### **Q: What's the difference between concrete and cement?**
A: Cement is an ingredient in concrete. Concrete is the finished product made from cement, sand, gravel, and water. Cement acts as the binding agent that holds everything together.
