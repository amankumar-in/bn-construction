## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How long does it take to build an ADU?**
A: From design to completion, most ADUs take 6-10 months. This includes 2-4 weeks for design, 4-8 weeks for permits, and 8-16 weeks for construction.

### **Q: Do I need special permits for an ADU?**
A: Yes, ADUs require building permits, but California law requires ministerial approval (no discretionary review) for most ADU projects.

### **Q: Can I rent out my ADU immediately?**
A: Yes, once you receive your Certificate of Occupancy, you can legally rent your ADU to tenants or use it for short-term rentals where allowed.

### **Q: Will an ADU affect my property taxes?**
A: Yes, ADUs will increase your property's assessed value and therefore your property taxes. However, the rental income typically more than offsets the tax increase.

### **Q: Can I build an ADU if I have an HOA?**
A: California law prevents HOAs from prohibiting ADUs, but they may have design guidelines you must follow. We help navigate HOA requirements.

### **Q: What utilities does an ADU need?**
A: ADUs need independent electrical meters but can share water, sewer, and gas services with the main house. We coordinate all utility connections.
